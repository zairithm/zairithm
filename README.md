👋 Hey, I’m Zaid

🚀 I build, break, and automate systems to understand how technology really works  from code to cloud to containers to decentralized systems.
I’m deeply focused on DevOps, Cloud, and Blockchain, and I believe in shipping real tools over perfect ones.

💡 My philosophy: Learn by doing, improve by iterating, and always keep building.

🧑‍💻 About Me

🌱 Exploring the intersection of DevOps, Cloud Infrastructure, and Blockchain

⚡ Skilled in automating workflows, setting up cloud systems, and experimenting with decentralized tech

🛠️ I’d rather ship a working script today than a perfect project someday

🐧 Linux enthusiast  I like knowing what’s happening under the hood

🧩 I learn by building, breaking, and fixing things until they make sense

Outside of tech, you’ll probably find me on the football field, bingeing horror movies, or diving into weird tech rabbit holes.
