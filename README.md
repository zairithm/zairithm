Hi there, I'm Zaid

I'm exploring DevOps, Cloud, and Cybersecurity while building small projects and learning how systems really work under the hood.

Right now, I’m focused on learning by doing. I don’t have all the answers yet, but I’m getting better every day — one terminal command, one commit, and one experiment at a time.



About Me

- Currently learning Git, Linux, AWS, and Python for automation
- Building a habit of pushing to GitHub daily
- Exploring how DevOps and security come together in real-world systems
- I prefer building small, working tools over perfect ones
- I’m someone who learns by breaking and fixing things

Outside tech, I spend time playing football, watching horror movies, or reading about weird tech stuff that most people scroll past.



Tech Stack (So Far)

Languages:  
Python (for scripting and automation)  
Bash (just started)

Cloud & DevOps:  
Linux (Ubuntu)  
Git & GitHub  
GitHub Actions (CI/CD basics)  
AWS (learning EC2, S3, IAM)  
Docker (beginner level)

Tools I Use:  
VS Code, Postman, Notion, and a lot of Stack Overflow

Currently exploring:  
Terraform, Ansible, and basic Cloud Security practices



What You'll Find on My GitHub

- Real, raw projects — no fake polish  
- Notes and setups that helped me  
- Progress, not perfection  
- Ideas I’m testing out, even if they break

If you're learning DevOps, Cloud, or Cybersecurity too — or just like building things from scratch — feel free to reach out or check out my work.
